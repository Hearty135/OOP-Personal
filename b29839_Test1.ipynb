    "In a family setting where household finances are managed jointly, encapsulation can be used to prevent misuse of funds by creating a single \"HouseholdBudget\" system. Only the  head of the family, designated parent or the treasurer can add expenses and update the budget. Other family members can request funds or view assigned allowances but cannot directly change totals. This prevents accidental or malicious modification of the total budget and ensures all changes go through validated processes For example needing a note or purpose for each withdrawal.\n"
